Here's a clear roadmap outlining steps to guide your development of the asteroid mining game from your existing working website:

### ðŸš€ Game Development Roadmap:

### Phase 1: Concept and Design (Pre-Development)
- **1.1 Game Design Document (GDD)**
  - Define core mechanics, game loop, win/lose conditions.
  - Document voxel system, resource processing, and automation systems.

- **1.2 Wireframes and UI Prototyping**
  - Design landing UI, resource management, and construction interfaces.

### Phase 2: Core Systems Development
- **2.1 Voxel Engine**
  - Implement a performant WebGL-based voxel rendering engine.
  - Enable voxel manipulation (add, remove, combine, subdivide).

- **2.2 Physics and Collision System**
  - Implement basic collision detection and physics interactions for voxel units and robots.

- **2.3 Resource Generation**
  - Design algorithms to procedurally generate realistic asteroid compositions (ice, metals, minerals).
  - Base resource values on real-world precious metal prices.

### Phase 3: Player Interaction Mechanics
- **3.1 Landing Mechanics**
  - Develop landing sequence with fuel management UI.
  - Allow precise placement on asteroid surfaces.

- **3.2 3D Printing System**
  - Create 3D printer mechanics within player's ship.
  - Enable crafting of single-voxel components and multi-voxel structures.

- **3.3 Basic Robot and AI**
  - Implement manual and AI-driven control systems for AsterDroids.
  - Build simple drones that can mine and transport resources autonomously.

### Phase 4: Resource Extraction and Crafting
- **4.1 Resource Extraction System**
  - Allow voxel-based mining of resources.
  - Visual feedback on extracted resource quantities.

- **4.2 Crafting and Processing**
  - Develop factories capable of processing raw resources into usable elements.
  - Allow crafting of machinery from refined materials.

### Phase 5: Automation and Factory Expansion
- **5.1 Automation System**
  - Develop programmable logic or simple automation interfaces.
  - Enable automated drones to mine, transport, and refine resources.

- **5.2 Expandable Factory Modules**
  - Implement modular, combinable structures like conveyor belts, refining stations, storage units.

- **5.3 Larger Scale Machinery**
  - Allow construction of progressively larger structures, culminating in propulsion engines for asteroid transport.

### Phase 6: Gameplay Loop and Progression
- **6.1 Mission Progression**
  - Design missions/tasks rewarding successful asteroid deliveries.
  - Incrementally larger asteroids and complexity to challenge players.

- **6.2 Economy Integration**
  - Track resource values and player finances.
  - Integrate economy allowing players to lease progressively bigger asteroids.

### Phase 7: Polishing and Testing
- **7.1 Visual and Audio Enhancements**
  - Improve graphical details, textures, lighting.
  - Add atmospheric audio, interactive sound effects.

- **7.2 User Experience and Accessibility**
  - Refine UI and UX for smooth player interaction.
  - Ensure accessibility (keyboard navigation, color contrast, readable fonts).

- **7.3 Playtesting and Feedback**
  - Conduct thorough internal and external playtesting.
  - Use player feedback to adjust game balance, controls, and features.

### Phase 8: Deployment and Post-Launch
- **8.1 Optimization and PWA**
  - Optimize game performance (Lighthouse, IndexedDB, Service Workers).
  - Ensure full offline functionality via service workers for a true PWA experience.

- **8.2 Continuous Updates**
  - Regular updates based on community feedback.
  - Introduce new asteroids, machinery, and scenarios to maintain engagement.

This roadmap will guide you clearly from initial concept through to launch and ongoing refinement, ensuring a manageable and structured development process.
